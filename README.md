# Farm_Products_Analysis_and_Prediction
This dataset provides insights into various aspects of agriculture, specifically focusing on farm-level details, crop types, irrigation methods, soil properties, and associated metrics such as yield, water usage, fertilizer usage, and pesticide usage. The goal is to analyze and predict crop yields and identify factors that influence productivity.

**Agricultural yield** is a critical factor that impacts food production, farmer profitability, and resource sustainability. This project leverages machine learning models to analyze key farm parameters such as crop type, irrigation methods, soil composition, and seasonal variationsâ€”to predict crop yields accurately. By understanding how factors like fertilizer usage, pesticide application, and water consumption influence productivity, farmers can make data-driven decisions to optimize resource allocation and improve harvest outcomes. The predictive insights generated by this model help in mitigating risks associated with climate change, soil degradation, and inefficient farming practices, ultimately enhancing agricultural efficiency and sustainability.
